# Go Programming Practice
This is my collection of hands on exercises and practice code following one of Udemy's courses on Go.
There will also be a collection of practice in Test Driven Development (TDD).
It didn't feel worth making a separate repo, if anything I'll pull out the Udemy directories and rename this project as they didn't feel as helpful as I hoped.

## Structure
I'm still learning the "right" way to handle Go modules, however for TDD it seems required to have a tests based on an individual module.
This means it seems simplest to have a directory per "project" (these are all tiny and not warranting their own repo) with a module defined for that project.
If I get to the point that this is no longer applicable, I will likely be moving to a separate repo.

## Resources
As mentioned above, this repo is a combination of work from two main resources.[Learn go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) and [Udemy's Learn How to Code: Google's Go...](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/)
These are both great resources, and explain the basics as well as breaking down some pretty deep topics for Golang into managable chunks. 
- [Udemy's Learn How to Code: Google's Go...](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/)
    - Udemy's video format is great and has some great demonstrations, and they have sales pretty regularly to get their courses for dirt cheap.
- [Learn go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)
    - Learn go with tests has been my first experience with TDD, as well as most of Go still being very new to me. Things are very clearly explained, and the process of writing a test, making the compiler pass, adding code, and refactoring is broken down and walked through very well.
    - Best of all this resource is free!
